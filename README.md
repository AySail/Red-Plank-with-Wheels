# Red Plank with Wheels

**Red Plank with Wheels** is a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) project built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), a popular JavaScript library that uses WebGL/OpenGL to create 3D graphics and games in the browser.

## About

In this simple 3D driving game, you control a red plank with wheels. Drive around on the grassy platform or dare to leave the platform and float into the void!

This project is designed for learners and developers interested in building 3D games with Three.js. Feel free to fork, learn from it, and build your own versions.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move the red plank forward, backward, and turn left or right.
- **Shift**: Hold to speed up and boost your movement.

## Features

- Basic 3D car-like controls using keyboard input.
- Simple red plank with wheels model.
- Textured grassy ground plane.
- Camera follows the player smoothly.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone this repo:
  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/red-plank-with-wheels.git


2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3. Use the arrow keys and shift to play.
